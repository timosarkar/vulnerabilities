# CVE-2025-22917: Reflected XSS in Audemium ERP v<=0.9.0

In the source code (list.php) of Audemium ERP v<=0.9.0 a GET request (URL param) will be stored and then directly outputted/echoed by PHP. This leads to a **reflective cross-site scripting attack**. Attackers can abuse this vulnerability to craft malicious web requests that get executed on the browser. 


## Proof-of-Reproduction:

1. go to https://audemium.com/erp/demo
2. login with username: demo / password: demo

```
GET https://audemium.com/erp/demo/list.php?type=<script>alert(1)</script>
```

3. Then verify if the malicious script has been stored, by inspecting the current site. The malicious code will be stored in the variable type and outputted by PHP to the page.


## Mitigation:

By using Web-Request sanitization, as well as adding WAF security, such attacks can be easily mitigated.
