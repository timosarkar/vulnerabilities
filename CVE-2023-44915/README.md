# CVE-2023-44915: Reflected XSS in c3CRM (Yike CRM https://www.c3crm.com/) <=3.0.4

## About the vendor/product:

C3CRM / Yike CRM is actively beeing used by more than 10'000 companies around the world (primarily in china).

## Vulnerability:

In the source code (Login.php) of c3CRM v<=3.0.4 a GET request (URL param) will be stored and then directly outputted/echoed by PHP. This leads to a **reflective cross-site scripting attack**. Attackers can abuse this vulnerability to craft malicious web requests that get executed on the browser. 


## Proof-of-Reproduction:

1. download login.php from https://github.com/dfar2008/c3crm/blob/2d3d74f2d65a400e0b5e069fd8945be1c71c0960/Login.php
2. serve locally using php
3. craft a malicious GET request

```
GET http://localhost:8000/?login_error=<script>alert("xss");</script>
```

3. Then verify if the malicious script has been executed. In this case if the alert popups.


## Mitigation:

By using Web-Request sanitization, as well as adding WAF security, such attacks can be easily mitigated.
